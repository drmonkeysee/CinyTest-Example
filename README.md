# CinyTest Example

Example code for CinyTest. Used for testing and inclusion in CinyTest's documentation.

Run `make` or `make debug` to build the rectangle unit tests and then run `make check` to execute the test suite. `make clean` will remove all build artifacts.

To view CinyTest command-line options run `build/recttests --ct-help` after building the project.
