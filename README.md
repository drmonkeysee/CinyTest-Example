# CinyTest Example

Example code for [CinyTest](https://github.com/drmonkeysee/CinyTest).

Before this example can be used, first build and install the CinyTest libraries and header using that project's Makefile. Then run `make` or `make debug` to build the example tests and `make check` to execute the test suite. `make clean` will remove all build artifacts. Finally, `make demo` executes several test runs to show off various combinations of CinyTest command-line options.

On Windows run the **winbuild.bat** file to build the tests. See the [CinyTest](https://github.com/drmonkeysee/CinyTest) documentation for more details on building for Windows.

To view CinyTest command-line options run `build/recttests --ct-help` after building the project.
